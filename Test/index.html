					<em class="title">Jay-Z also says that he prefers to watch sports more than anything else on television because, "The outcome of that is real."</em>
					<p class="first">Jay-Z announced the release of his <span class="highlight">Magna Carta Holy Grail </span>album on television during the NBA finals last month, but that doesn't mean that the Rap mogul watches much television himself. "I'm really just [an] ESPN, HBO guy," Jay-Z says <span class="highlight">during an interview </span>with New York radio station Hot 97. "That's pretty much the extent of my TV." </p>

					<p>A minority owner of the Brooklyn Nets and owner of the <span class="highlight">Roc Nation Sports agency</span>, Jay-Z says he enjoys watching sports in particular. "That's the only thing that's real," he says. "The outcome of that is real, although people want to believe that it's fixed. 'We're going to go to Game 7 because the NBA fixed it.' Nah. It's the real thing. That's the real reality show."</p>

					<p>As for reality television itself, Jay-Z says he is not a fan of the genre, although he watches it on occassion. "I'm not into that," he says. "That's not my business. I'm not into that. I don't have enough time in the day to invest in it."</p>

					<p>Jay-Z doesn't invest much time in watching the news, either, as he says it has an agenda. "CNN is almost like TMZ," Jay-Z says during the interview. "Certain things, it's like, 'Ah, man. This is like really just entertainment.' It's really like all for ratings at the end of the day. And you squeeze a bit of information in there."</p>

					<p>Jay-Z's wife Beyonce released the HBO documentary <span class="highlight">Life Is But A Dream </span>in February, which he says he did watch. Hova said he had mixed emotions about the film. "It gave me a little anxiety," he says. "But, you know, it's something she had to do, she wanted to do, so you just fall back and enjoy. I had a little anxiety, but it was all good. You feel weird just putting yourself out there in that sort of way, especially when you reveal so much in your music. If feels like, 'Any more and I'm gonna be naked out here.'"</p>
